### Figure 1
A unitary diagram for the three-body decay. The arrows show the initial and final state particles, and the blob stands for the interaction that transforms the initial state into the final state.  

### Figure 2
A sketch illustrating the recursive relation when computing the phase-space expression. This is not a dynamic assumption but a mathematical trick that rewrites the full three-body phase-space through lower-dimensional phase-space elements and the two-body phase-space, for which the expression is simple.  

### Figure 3
The Dalitz plot, a representation of the phase-space for the three-body decay. It appears as an ellipse-shaped area where the internal region corresponds to allowed kinematics and the outside region is forbidden. On the x-axis lies the squared mass of two final-state particles, while the y-axis corresponds to the other subsystem. A horizontal line represents a slice of the phase-space with one mass fixed. The borders of the area correspond to configurations where all three momenta are aligned in the rest frame of the decaying particle, or equivalently, where the scattering angle in the relevant rest frame is either 0 or Ï€.  

### Figure 4
A diagram showing the spin projection. The horizontal line arrow indicates the z-axis, which is chosen as the quantization axis. The arrow denotes the particle spin, and its projection onto the axis is represented by m in the equations.  

### Figure 5
A dynamic diagram of a cascade decay, where particle 0 decays to a three-body final state through an intermediate state x that sequentially decays into particles 1 and 2. The intermediate particle carries spin j and serves as an expansion term of the full amplitude, known as the partial projection term. Lines represent initial and final state particles, while the double line denotes the intermediate particle.  

### Figure 6
A kinematic representation of the transition from the initial state to the final state in the process where particle 0 decays into particle x and particle 3. The arrows indicate the three-momenta of particles 3 and x, and the fat dot marks particle 0, which is at rest in this frame.  

### Figure 7
A kinematic configuration for the introduction of the helicity matrix in the transition of particle x decaying into particles 1 and 2. The representation is drawn in the rest frame of particle x, shown as a dot at rest, with arrows representing the three-momenta of particles 1 and 2 in this frame.
